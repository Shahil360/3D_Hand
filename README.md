# 3D_Hand

With the use of a glove equipped with flex sensors that we have developed, and by connecting it to an Arduino board, we've built a system that brings a virtual hand to life. Our glove captures real-time hand movements, to move a 3D hand model. Arduino was programmed using C++, and the Unity scripts were written in C#. Additionally, the hand model was designed using Blender.
